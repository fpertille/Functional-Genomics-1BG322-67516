# Functional Genomics

Hello and welcome to the Functional Genomics lab 2! 

LAB 2 - "Mastering Bash: Learning Basic Commands and Scripting for Omic Analysis"

Mastering Bash: Learning Basic Commands and Scripting for Genomic Analysis" is an introductory-level laboratory course designed to provide participants with foundation in Bash scripting language and command-line tools commonly used in genomics research. In this course, we will be using the Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science (UPPMAX) platform for storage and processing.
Participants will learn how to navigate the file system, manipulate files and directories, process text files, and write simple Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks. The focus will be on applying these skills to typical genomics workflows, such as sequence alignment, quality control, and variant calling.
In addition to learning the basics of Bash scripting, we will also delve into topics such as how a Slurm queue system works, how to manage the environment using the module system, and how to transfer data efficiently.
By the end of this course, participants will have gained practical skills and knowledge necessary to work with genomic data in a Unix-based environment, as well as familiarity with the computational infrastructure used by many research institutions in Sweden.

Here you can find the whole workflow for the GBS-MeDIP method, it is not ready for publication, but it is in development,
You will select only two scripts to run, please, check in your manual which one of them you are going to upload to Uppmax!
